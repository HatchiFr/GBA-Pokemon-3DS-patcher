# GBA Pokemon 3DS Patcher
A little utility to patch GBA roms for 3DS.

## Usage
Call it from a command line using `patch.py <rom.gba>` or `python patch.py <rom.gba>` with the rom in the same folder.  
If the ROM is known from the database (located at the root), it will perform a check of hash before and after patching.  
** WARNING : This tool overwrites the original ROM without warning **
